# Shadcn/ui port for Go + Templ + Alpine.js + Tailwind CSS

### Note

This is a work in proccess. 

- Not all the components from shadcn/ui are implemented.
- There are refinements needed for some of the components - alpine.js naming, unfinished accessibility, improvements I want to make, etc.
- Some components might contain behavior that existed for previous needs (I detached the developement of this from another project). Hopefully will be fixed in the future.

## Overview

A [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) port using [Go](https://go.dev/), [Templ](https://templ.guide/), [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
